`gen_polygon.py`: Perform attack decomposition on polygon attacked models. Visualization and decomposed trigger will be saved in `forensic/trojai_polygon/`.

`gen_instagram.py`: Perform attack decomposition on instagram filter attacked models. Visualization and decomposed trigger will be saved in `forensic/trojai_instagram/`.

`abs_beagle_polygon.py`: Provide the BEAGLE-enhanced ABS to scan polygon attacked models. Result will be outputed in `result.txt`.

`abs_beagle_filter.py`: Provide the BEAGLE-enhanced ABS to scan instagram filter attacked models. Result will also be outputed in `result.txt`.

`synthesis_scanner.py`: Provide the summarized polygon/filter trigger distributions (polygon size/filter parameters) which help build enhanced scanner for ABS.
